<h1>Fictional Secret Database (Client-Only Demo)</h1>

<h3>‚ö†Ô∏èDemo Only! Not Secure & not meant to be used for anything serious </h3>

<p>This is my first time ever working on JavaScript (JS), and I made a website that pretends to be a database of some sort that holds fictional names, address, and phone numbers. The purpose of this is to just practice my skill and learn about how data is stored, reused, and how scripts respond to a user event</p>

## What it does
- The opening page will lets the user to **register** and then **log in**
- Once loged in, it will open up a table of fake datas **for demo purposes**
- The user credential is stored on **localStorages** only, meaning everything you do is in *YOUR* browser
- I evem added a **SHA-256 hasing function** just to show myself and the user how it would look lie in a browser, feel free to open DevTools and check it out

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Features I used</h2>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>localStorage (for saving your local demo credential)
</li>

----------

Even though it might be simple to some, to me this project projects my understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JS will work together to have a functioning webiste for the user to interact with! This is just one of many many steps into my web development journey

<p>if this finds you well, thanks for even taking a peek! I will continue working on my skills and always open for feedback üôå
